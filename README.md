## Manual Install

Add this right here to your `.emacs` config file.

![](/caroline4.png)

`(load-theme 'caroline t)`

Will have it load during emacs startup.

`M-x load-theme RET caroline` will load it manually.

Download caroline-theme.el to the directory ~/.emacs.d/themes/ and add this to your .emacs:

```emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes/")
```

Feel free to yank it down and do whatever you want with it.

I have not added this to MELPA and don't think I will be. Sorry!

Just wrote this for fun in  a day. (-:
