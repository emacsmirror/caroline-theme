## Manual Install

```emacs-lisp
(load-theme 'caroline t)
```

Emacs 24 will find the theme file whose name ends with -theme.el under the directory defined by variable custom-theme-load-path. Default directory is ~/.emacs.d/.

Download caroline-theme.el to the directory ~/.emacs.d/themes/ and add this to your .emacs:

```emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes/")
```
